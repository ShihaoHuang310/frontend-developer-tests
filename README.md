# Frontend Engineering Problem


## API:
```
https://randomuser.me/api/?results=100
```

## Objective
- Render a list of Countries sorted by the number of Users in each country
- Clicking a country should expand the list of users in that country sorted by the date registered most recent first
- Each user should show the Name, Gender, City, State, and Date Registered
- Only one country's users should be visible at once
- There should be a dropdown that filters the Users by Gender (Male, Female, All)
## Notes
- Attention should be on functionality and less on aesthetics, we have provided some base styles in src/App.css
- Candidates can use any third party libraries to accomplish the objective
- We expect this to take between 2-4 hours
- Third party is not allowed
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
